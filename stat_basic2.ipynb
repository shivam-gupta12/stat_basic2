Covariance measures whether a variation in one variable results in a variation in another variable; for example, looking at whether an increase in one variable results in an increase, decrease, or no change in the other variable. Correlation measures the direction as well as the strength of the relationship between two variables (i.e. how strongly these two variables are related to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship constraints: Covariance deals with the linear relationship of only two variables in the dataset, whereas correlation can involve two or multiple variables or data sets and their linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value range: Although both correlation coefficient and covariance are measures of linear association, correlation coefficients are standardized, therefore displaying an absolute value within a definite range from -1 to 1. On the other hand, covariance values are not standardized and use an indefinite range from -∞ to +∞ , which makes the interpretation of covariance a bit tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement units: Correlation is dimensionless, i.e. it is a unit-free measure of the relationship between variables. In contrast,  covariance is in units, which is formed by multiplying the unit of one variable by the unit of another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change in scale: Covariance is affected by the change in scale, i.e. if all the values of one variable are multiplied by a constant and all the values of another variable are multiplied by a similar or different constant, then the covariance is changed. Conversely, correlation is not affected by the change in scale.\n"
